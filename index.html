    <p>|God's gift is immensely uncountable and a rare present which
         must be adored at every single day that passes by. There is
         a time to be born and a time to die_all of these are 
         intertwained in one packet___life is short. Do your very 
         best to live happily with a grateful heart to Godsand the 
         heavenlies. You will certainly evaporate and be remembered
          no more.God lives for ever and only Him shall all 
          men(the righteous ones) go to while the villains burn in 
          hell. Consider this too! I'm Ray and this concept is 
          called raywisation|</p>
